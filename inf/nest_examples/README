This directory contains several example files for PyNEST. Here is a small
summary of the files and their content. For more details, see the comments
in the files.

start.py  This is a simple example for how to execute SLI commands from within
    Python. It does not use anything from the high-level PyNEST API.

testiaf.py  In this example, a single integrate-and-fire neuron is created and
    fed with input from a DC generator. The activity of the neuron is recorded
    by a spike_detector and a voltmeter. Their output is directly printed.
